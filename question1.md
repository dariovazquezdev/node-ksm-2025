Imagine users are reporting intermittent authentication failures in a Node.js application integrated with Okta. What would be your systematic approach to diagnose and resolve this issue?

Haven't worked with Okta before, but:

* I would first look at the logs for Node and Okta(?).
* Would try to determine if there is a pattern to these issues (maybe it only happens on a specific time of the day or for specific users)
* Would check for infrastructure or network configuration.

Best practices to prevent common security vulnerabilities:
* Monitoring and alerting. Ideally, we should know if there is an ongoing issue before our users reach out to us. Having some alerts that get triggered when a threshold is surpassed is a good practice. It is also useful to look for patterns. Tools like Datadog are useful for this.
* MFA
* TL
* Regularly updating dependencies
* Short-lived access tokens
